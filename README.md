## Abstract:
### Exploring Object-Oriented Programming through Game Development: A Case Study on Connect 4 in Python

This project focuses on leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to develop a game, 
specifically Connect 4, in Python. OOP emphasizes organizing code around data and objects rather than procedural logic.
Through this endeavor, our group aims to deepen our understanding of OOP concepts and their practical application 
in software development. The primary objective is to gain hands-on experience in implementing OOP principles to create 
a functional and interactive game. By choosing Python as the programming language due to its inherent support for OOP,
we aim to master both the language and the OOP paradigm simultaneously. The Connect 4 game will feature a graphical 
user interface allowing players to interact with the game board by strategically placing colored chips with the goal 
of forming a sequence of four chips in a row. This project serves as a platform to explore the versatility of OOP in 
creating diverse types of programs while honing our Python programming skills.
