## Abstract:
    Object Oriented Programming is the concept of programming that is centered around data and objects, 
rather than functions and logic. For this project, we decided as a group to create a game, which will be coded 
using Object-Oriented Design. The goal for this project is to gain a better understanding of Object-Oriented Design, 
and how it can be used to create various types of programs. With this project, we also seek to learn more about how 
to program in the Python language. Given that Python is an Object-Oriented programming language, it is an ideal 
language to use for this project. This game will be a Connect 4 game, and will include graphics that feature
a board which players can place colored chips on, in an attempt to get 4 of them arranged in a row.
