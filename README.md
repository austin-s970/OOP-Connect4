## Abstract:
### Exploring Object-Oriented Programming through Game Development: A Case Study on Connect 4 in Python

This project focuses on leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to develop a game, 
specifically Connect 4, in Python. OOP emphasizes organizing code around data and objects rather than procedural logic.
Through this endeavor, our group aims to deepen our understanding of OOP concepts and their practical application 
in software development. The primary objective is to gain hands-on experience in implementing OOP principles to create 
a functional and interactive game. By choosing Python as the programming language due to its inherent support for OOP,
we aim to master both the language and the OOP paradigm simultaneously. The Connect 4 game will feature a graphical 
user interface allowing players to interact with the game board by strategically placing colored chips with the goal 
of forming a sequence of four chips in a row. This project serves as a platform to explore the versatility of OOP in 
creating diverse types of programs while honing our Python programming skills.

#### Self Grade Justification

As a group, we have given ourselves the grade of 95%. This is because we centered our project on fundamental OOD concepts, such as getters, modularity, inheritance, etc. We also used 3 Design patterns throughout our project- namely, Singleton, Iterator, and Mediator. While we followed many practices of OOD, there are still some things we could've improved, such as achieving 100% test coverage, designing a more detailed user interface, etc. However, we did test our code for correctness with 96% coverage, and have documentation in the form of HTML and UML diagrams, which we as a team used to explain our project to the audience during presentation. During the course of the project, we worked as a team on various tasks and making sure we meet the project requirements, while dividing the tasks between the three of us. To track the progress that we were making, we used a Kanban Board and Gant Chart on GitHub Projects.
